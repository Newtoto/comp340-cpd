# Comp340 CPD Weekly Reports
## Week 1 - Mon 28th January
Working back on the game project primarily we have decided to change direction for the game. This will essentially restart the game project since there is not much code that can be reused, and the art assets will need completely remaking as the art style has changed. It comes up a lot that I need to get the core gameplay element working and that's again what I didn't have working last semester, but a smaller time scale makes it easier to scope.

Also did a game jam where I learnt to do 3D modelling, nice to try picking up something new from the knowledge of the other students in the academy while I have access to it.

## Week 2 - Mon 4th February
Decided that it would be best to set a weekly reminder for the porting and optimisation journal so that I would keep up with frequent updates to make it more manageable. Learning from past experience I am not going to be sticking to uploading on the Wednesday since I get drained quickly if I feel so locked into a task.

## Week 3 - Mon 11th February
Been working on some refactoring of the game project code for the optimisation module. It's good to clean things up a bit, but I find it difficult not to go overboard with trying to clean up the code and make it as efficient as possible, both in writing and performance. This also included a large refactor of a class, I made a lot of changes and planning before hand on a whiteboard has helped out a lot because it worked without additional tweaks or fixes.

## Week 4 - Mon 18th February
Been working in python with my raspberry pi for my dissertation project. Struggling to switch between languages because I don't like losing the momentum that comes with switching projects. I'm not sure if this is something that I need to actually work on or it's just because of a university context that I need to be so adaptable to working with several languages on several projects at once. I've found it also means that you miss out on the part of programming where you're not working on something but still end up coming up with solutions, just because of the mix of things this doesn't seem to happen.

## Week 5 - Mon 25th February
Have really dropped in motivation and attendance generally, kinda stuck not really knowing what to do about it. A lot of it is circumstantial so there's not much I can do other than let it pass, but in the mean time I feel like I'm just falling behind with things and it's going to make it a lot more difficult to get back into it.

## Week 6 - Mon 4th March
With show and tell week coming up we're trying to get the game in a state where we can show it off in a trailer. Before I have wanted to present, but in reality I can get too anxious and shakey when presenting even if I'm not aware that this will happen before hand. For this reason last year I was unable to present so I didn't put myself forward for it this year. Also I have acknoledged my time strains and didn't make the trailer this year either.

## Week 7 - Mon 11th March
At show and tell week I used this as an opportunity to talk to other students in more depth about their dissertation projects to get a better idea as what to do. Kinda been easing myself back into attendance of things and this was a good way to do it.

## Week 8 - Mon 18th March
Started working on some personal projects to try and get my motivation back by giving myself more creative freedom. The aim is to get some passion back for programming, I find the later stages of a game project less interesting as well as having the temptation to recode everything, even if it's not necessary, so I am trying this as a way of motivating myself through it.

## Week 9 - Mon 25th March
Been able to do longer stints of working, but it's still very fluctuatey and not at very appropriate times for working with the team. This may impact how much the team perceive my work on the project to be, but I just kinda need to work from home for a bit to get things done, I can't concentrate in the studio.

## Week 10 - Mon 1st April
Been working towards applying for extenuating circumstances for my dissertation because the amount of work along with other things is making me unable to think or work on anything. Will need to get assistance with filling this out, but I have made progress towards getting it. Hopefully once this is sorted I'll be able to think about my work easier. Had to delay this because of having to apply no more than two weeks before the deadline, which is kinda weird for a huge assignment.

## Week 11 - Mon 8th April
Been working on a final few things for the optimisation assignment since that is due in next. This is actually the first time for this assignment that I have used the Unity profiller and I'm finding it quite good to use. Really got into a flow with typing up the work I was doing, even if the typing seems to stall my work speed. Need to stop thinking about efficiency so much, because it's not possible to reach complete efficiency. There are also certainly factors to efficiency that I'm not able to take into account such as giving yourself time to think and not overloading/burning out.

## Week 12 - Mon 29th April
Ended up doing a lot of work on the game throughout Easter due the porting assignment. This was trickier since my porting aims had changed from PS4 to MacOS, meaning I had to design a new control system for the game. This went reasonably well though. One thing that may be an issue is I tend to like working on projects when other people aren't working on them, such as late at night or during Easter. This is easier to get into a headspace without distractions and things breaking, but I may need to learn to work better in an office or studio environment.

## Week 13 - Mon 6th May
Had demo day this week along with the BA's submission for the game. I'm pretty pleased with how the game turned out. Although it's not a huge game in terms of playtime, it definitely feels like the most polished game I have worked on and shows a progression over my three years at the Uni. Nice to see the payoff of working and learning.
